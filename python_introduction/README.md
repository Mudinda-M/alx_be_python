## üìÇ Project Structure

All tasks are located in the `python_introduction/` directory:

| Filename                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `basic_operations.py`     | Performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two numbers.         |
| `simple_interest.py`      | Calculates simple interest from given principal, rate, and time.           |
| `rectangle_area.py`       | Calculates the area of a rectangle using length and width.                 |
| `hours_to_seconds.py`     | Converts hours into seconds.                                               |
| `future_age_calculator.py`| Takes user input for age and calculates their age in 2050.                 |
| `finance_calculator.py`   | Advanced: Calculates monthly savings and projects annual savings with interest. |
