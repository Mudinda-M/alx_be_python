# Control Flow Projects - ALX Back End Program

This directory contains Python scripts developed as part of the **ALX Back End Program**. These tasks demonstrate the use of conditional statements, loops, and the `match-case` structure to control the flow of execution in Python.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 0. Weather Recommendation Program - `weather_advice.py`
- **Objective:** Provide clothing recommendations based on user input about the weather.
- **Features:**
  - Uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
  - Handles unexpected input with an appropriate message.
- **Example:**  
  `What's the weather like today? (sunny/rainy/cold): sunny`  
  ‚ûù `Wear a t-shirt and sunglasses.`

### 1. Simple Calculator with Match Case - `match_case_calculator.py`
- **Objective:** Perform basic arithmetic operations using `match-case`.
- **Features:**
  - Prompts for two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
  - Uses `match-case` to perform the correct calculation.
  - Handles division by zero gracefully.
- **Example:**  
  `Enter the first number: 10`  
  `Enter the second number: 5`  
  `Choose the operation (+, -, *, /): *`  
  ‚ûù `The result is 50.`

### 2. Multiplication Table Generator - `multiplication_table.py`
- **Objective:** Generate the multiplication table for a given number using a `for` loop.
- **Features:**
  - Prompts the user to input a number.
  - Prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10.
- **Example:**  
  `Enter a number to see its multiplication table: 5`  
  ‚ûù

### 3. Drawing Patterns with Nested Loops - `pattern_drawing.py`
- **Objective:** Draw a square pattern of asterisks using a `while` loop and a nested `for` loop.
- **Features:**
- Prompts the user for a positive integer.
- Prints a square pattern of that size using `*`.
- **Example:**  
`Enter the size of the pattern: 4`  
‚ûù

### 4. Personal Daily Reminder - `daily_reminder.py`
- **Objective:** Create a simple personal task reminder based on priority and time-sensitivity.
- **Features:**
- Prompts the user for a task, its priority, and if it's time-bound.
- Uses `match-case` and conditional statements to generate a relevant reminder.
- **Example:**  
`Enter your task: Finish project report`  
`Priority (high/medium/low): high`  
`Is it time-bound? (yes/no): yes`  
‚ûù `Reminder: 'Finish project report' is a high priority task that requires immediate attention today!`
